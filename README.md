Rough Explanation: 
This app is aimed to educate people on their spending habits and financial literacy while also gamifying their decision making. It is essentially a purchasing platform that actually allows users to buy items but instead displays the products in column categories that reflect the user's choice of category of item to buy (e.g. clothes, beauty, household items), combined with an ordering of how expensive the items are in each category in order to create a grid of items available to the user. This platform should include features such as:
- User login and Registration
- User selection of what categories of items to buy
- An AI-Powered smart recommendation system such that the grid's suggested recommendations (FOR THE USER'S THINGS TO BUY) will be based on users' purchase history and similar users' purchase history as input and a grid of items as an output. Uses Knot's API key (says "powered by Knot at the bottom")
- Actually buys the items upon click of a button through Amazon API 
- A Gemini-Powered RAG w/ user history
